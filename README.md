# simple-text-editor

This is a very simple text editor made with Tkinter, based on the code taught in the "Python Programming Bible" course.

## Features

The features of this text editor are very basic. They include:

- Menus with the option to open, save, edit a file.

## Future features

The features I'll add in the future are:

- Cut, copy, & paste.
- The ability to run Python code from the text editor itself.
